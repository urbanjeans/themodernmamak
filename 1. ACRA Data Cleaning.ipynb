Historically, these stalls sold groceries and sundry items, serving the everyday needs in local communities. These stores also serve certain cultural demands for traditional spices and ingredients that often originate from India or China. The term \"mamak\" comes from the Tamil word \"maa-ma,\" meaning “uncle”, as these were often honorifics used by children in Singapore to respectfully address adults in these stores. At their peak in the early 2000s, there were around 3,000 mamak stalls; however, due to increased competition from chain convenience stores, large supermarkets, and online shopping, the number has dwindled to just about a few hundred today.\n","\n","The decline of mamak stalls signified an economic and cultural shift. As housing developments experience intensive urban development and the advent of growing corporations, traditional mamak stalls are being outcompeted by larger, corporatized grocery chains and convenient stores that lack the unique character these shops once brought to public housing estates. Over the years, this change has made the experience of living in public housing less distinctive and more homogenised. Moreover, this shift risks outpricing lower income demographics of residents, catering primarily to residents with greater financial ability. This represents a form of spatial injustice within local communities. Additionally, these mamak stalls were also the primary income for small business owners, some of whom now try to adopt new roles as collection points for e-commerce delivery. Other mamak stores have since closed down as their traditional businesses models have become less viable.\n","\n","This project utilises a couple of data sources provided by Singapore's state-owned organisations. The shop dataset in this document is collected from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority of Singapore (ACRA) with the following as the definition of mamak shops:\n","\n","* Shops with Primary SSIC code 47102 (mini-marts, convenience stores and provision shops)\n","* Shops without a Secondary SSIC (shops without secondary functions)\n","* Shops that are 'Sole Proprietory' businesses\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","###Contents:\n","1.
